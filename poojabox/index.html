                Raksha Bandhan
                Raksha Bandhan is a festival that celebrates the sacred bond between brothers and sisters. Celebrated on
                Shravana Purnima (Full Moon of the Shravana month) every year, this festival holds a special place in
                Hindu
                tradition. To celebrate this festival, sisters tie thread around their brothers’ wrists and vow to
                protect
                them for a lifetime. As a sweet gesture, brothers pamper their sisters with gifts and other goodies.
                Raksha Bandhan is going to fall on August 11th (Thursday), this year. At MyPoojaBox, we have something

                Hinduism, his father is the Hindu deity named Shiva. He is the destroyer in the Holy Trinity of Gods

                head from which comes out a curved trunk. He also has big ears on a big human body. His favorite
                offering is
